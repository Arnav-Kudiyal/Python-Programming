### ⚡ what’s this repo?

this is my **digital brain dump** for everything i do while learning python.  
no structure. no order. just pure chaos + vibes.  

expect:
- 💀 cursed code  
- 🧠 occasional moments of brilliance (rare)  
- 🔥 files named like `final_final_realfinal_v3.py`  
- 🪦 comments that age like milk  

---

### 📚 what’s inside?

- `basics/` → me pretending to understand syntax  
- `dsa/` → data structures but make it emotional  
- `projects/` → sometimes they even run??  
- `trash/` → …don’t ask. just don’t.  

---

### 🧃 requirements:

- python 3.x (obviously)  
- caffeine supply  
- spotify playlist named “grind till i disappear”  
- ability to google error messages like a pro

### 🤡 what i’m doing here

learning python one existential crisis at a time.  
writing stuff. deleting it. rewriting it again because apparently that’s “debugging”.  

---

### 💀 warning

- 90% chance the code works by accident.  
- 100% chance it made me question my life choices.  
- proceed at your own risk.
